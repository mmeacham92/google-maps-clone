## Google MyMaps clone

This is the second project in Rahul Pandey's Android Development Course


### Main Concepts

- Integrate map/location data
- Navigate between screens with data
- Persisting data

### Feature Ideas

- Allow user to edit existing map
- Allow user to delete map from list (works now, but still want to work on next bullet)
- (Long press map title, bring up options to edit or remove?)
- Show more info on MainActivity (maybe number of markers)
- CreateMap could start on current location
- Store data on a server and allow sharing of maps? (Firebase??)
- Store data using SQLite/Room
